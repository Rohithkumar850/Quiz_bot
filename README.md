Creating a quiz bot

**Project Description**
Develop a local quiz bot focused on network security, capable of generating random questions and offering specific topic questions. The bot will utilize open-source alternatives to ChatGPT to run locally, ensuring data privacy by keeping information within the user's system. The quiz will include multiple-choice questions (MCQs), true/false questions, and open-ended questions, with answers sourced from a network security database.
